• How to compile the program
    - run "make" to compile everything
    - can also run "make test1, make test2, ... make testN" to compile and run indivudual inputN files.

• The purpose of your program
    The purpose of this program is to take a given dependancy graph and execute the commands in its nodes.

• What exactly your program does
    Given a dependancy graph (passed as a .txt file argument) and a mode selection (passed as an argument flag "-p" or lack thereof), the program will either:
        - execute the commands in each node using fork, exec, or wait calls, sequentially using DFS
        - exectue the commands in each node using fork, exec, or wait calls, in parallel
