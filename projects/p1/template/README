• How to compile the program
    - run "make" to compile everything
    - can also run indivudual inputN files:
        - make run<N><p if parallel mode>
        - examples: 
            - "make run3p" will compile and then run "./depGraph -p ../testcases/input3.txt"
            - "make run1" will compile and then run "./depGraph ../testcases/input1.txt"

• The purpose of your program
    The purpose of this program is to take a given dependancy graph and execute the commands in its nodes.

• What exactly your program does
    Given a dependancy graph (passed as a .txt file argument) and a mode selection (passed as an argument flag "-p" or lack thereof), the program will either:
        - execute the commands in each node using fork, exec, or wait calls, sequentially using DFS
        - exectue the commands in each node using fork, exec, or wait calls, in parallel
